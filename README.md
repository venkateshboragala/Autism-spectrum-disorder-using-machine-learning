# Autism-spectrum-disorder-using-machine-learning
Built a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using screening and behavioral data. Applied data preprocessing and classification algorithms to support early and accurate detection.

🧠 Autism Spectrum Disorder Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition that affects communication, behavior, and social interaction. Early detection of ASD plays a crucial role in improving treatment outcomes and providing timely support.

This project focuses on building a Machine Learning-based predictive model to identify the likelihood of Autism Spectrum Disorder using screening and behavioral dataset features. The goal is to assist healthcare professionals with faster and data-driven preliminary screening.

🎯 Objective

To analyze ASD screening data and identify key behavioral indicators.

To build and compare multiple machine learning models for accurate prediction.

To evaluate model performance using standard classification metrics.

📊 Dataset Description

The dataset includes features such as:

Age

Gender

Ethnicity

Family history of ASD

Behavioral screening scores (AQ-10 questionnaire responses)

Screening results

Data preprocessing steps include:

Handling missing values

Encoding categorical variables

Feature scaling

Train-test splitting

🤖 Machine Learning Models Used

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Model performance is evaluated using:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

Confusion Matrix

📈 Results

The models were compared to determine the most accurate and reliable predictor. Random Forest (or your best model) achieved the highest performance, demonstrating strong capability in identifying potential ASD cases.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas & NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

💡 Key Insights

Behavioral screening responses play a significant role in ASD prediction.

Ensemble models provided better accuracy compared to individual classifiers.

Machine Learning can assist in early screening but does not replace professional medical diagnosis.

🚀 Future Improvements

Deploy the model using Flask/Streamlit for real-time screening.

Improve accuracy using hyperparameter tuning and advanced ensemble techniques.

Use larger and more diverse datasets for better generalization.
